<h2>ðŸ“‚ Java Projects ðŸ“‚</h2>

<p>This repository contains a collection of key projects I've developed in Java, featuring functionalities such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>File reading and writing:</strong> Implementations that handle data stored in local files.</li>
  <li><strong>Object serialization:</strong> Projects that convert objects into a format suitable for storage or transfer.</li>
  <li><strong>Menu interface:</strong> Interactive programs with menus that allow navigation and execution of various options.</li>
  <li><strong>Projects containing all of the above:</strong> Interactive programs with menus that allow navigation, object serialization, and save/load functionality when the application is closed and reopened.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideal for exploring key Java concepts such as file handling, serialization, and basic user interaction structures.</p>
